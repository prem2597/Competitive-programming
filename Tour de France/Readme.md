A racing bicycle is driven by a chain connecting two sprockets. Sprockets are grouped into two clusters: the front cluster (typically consisting of 2 or 3 sprockets) and the rear cluster (typically consisting of between 5 and 10 sprockets). At any time the chain connects one of the front sprockets to one of the rear sprockets.
You are to compute the maximum spread between two adjacent drive ratios achieved by a particular pair of front and rear clusters.
