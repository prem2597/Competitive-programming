You have bought a car in order to drive from Waterloo to a big city. The odometer on their car is broken, so you cannot measure distance. But the speedometer and cruise control both work, so the car can maintain a constant speed which can be adjusted from time to time in response to speed limits, traffic jams, and border queues. You have a stopwatch and note the elapsed time every time the speed changes. From time to time you wonder, “how far have I come?”. To solve this problem you must write a program to run on your laptop computer in the passenger seat.
