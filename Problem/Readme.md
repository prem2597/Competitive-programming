The formula of El Mamum, Calif of Baghdad around 800 A.D lacked parenthesis and was ambiguous which is 1 + 2 ∗ 3 ∗ 4 + 5, which had its origin in the financial accounts of a camel transaction. So, he decided to ask savants to provide him with a method to find which interpretation is the most advantageous for him, depending on whether is is buying or selling the camels.
