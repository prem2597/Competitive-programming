Socializing can be a very complicated thing among teenagers. For example, finding a good seating arrangement in a movie theater can be a difficult task. Here is a list of constraints that could potentially apply to two individuals A and B in this situation:

    if A and B are dating, then they must sit beside each other
    if A and B are fighting, then they cannot sit beside each other
    if A and B have just broke up, then they must sit at opposite ends of the row

Teenage politics is a complicated thing meaning the constraints can get even more complicated than those listed above. However, we restrict this problem to a particular form of constraint that simply specifies a lower or upper bound on the number of seats separating two specific individuals.

The group arrives after everyone else watching the show has been seated. By some stroke of luck, there are exactly as many open seats as there are teenagers and all of these seats appear consecutively in the front row. How many possible seating arrangements satisfy the constraints?
