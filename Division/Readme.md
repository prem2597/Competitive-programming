Write a program that finds and displays all pairs of 5-digit numbers that between them use the digits 0 through 9 once each, such that the first number divided by the second is equal to an integer N, where 2 ≤ N ≤ 79.

where each letter represents a different digit. The first digit of one of the numerals is allowed to be zero.

Input Format

Each line of the input file consists of a valid integer N. An input of zero is to terminate the program.

Output Format

Your program have to display ALL qualifying pairs of numerals, sorted by increasing numerator (and, of course, denominator).

Your output should be in the following general form:

xxxxx / xxxxx = N

xxxxx / xxxxx = N
